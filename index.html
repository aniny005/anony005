              "Education is a powerful tool that can empower individuals in various ways. It provides knowledge, skills, and opportunities that help individuals achieve their goals and lead a fulfilling life. Education helps individuals make informed decisions by developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills.

Education also provides opportunities for personal and professional growth, opening up new career opportunities and allowing individuals to network with like-minded individuals. Through my personal experience, I have seen how education has transformed individuals, including myself, by providing these benefits. Overall, education is an essential aspect of personal and societal development that should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It has depicted Nepali society about the Sati tradition that was prevalent until the 1920s. The film has beautifully presented the issues of violence against women. \"Has Nepalese society really passed through such inhuman tradition?\" is the question every youngster wonders about. <br><br> The plot develops with the death of Garima's husband in which she has to immolate herself upon her husband's death, typically on his funeral pyre. She is supposed to be burnt alive with the dead body of her husband according to the tradition. However, she escapes the fire and hides in a cave. The help of her son fascinates the audience. <br><br> Almost all the scenes seem realistic and historical. Traditional tools like dhiki, janto, madaani, etc. give a traditional look to the film. Similarly traditional lights like ranko, diyalo and fire place represent ancient environment to the spectators. In addition to Sati tradition, the movie also touches Kamara Kamari(a kind of slavery) tradition. What a beautiful cinematography it is! I think costumes of the artists and the leaf music in traditional tunes touch the heart of every one present in the cinema hall. Garima's natural appearance, her role and her acting are spellbinding and add to the beauty of the movie. <br><br> This is a must watch movie. Don't miss it.",

              "Saraswati Puga was a special event that I looked forward to every year during my school days. It was a festival dedicated to the goddess of knowledge, Saraswati, and was celebrated by students all over Nepal. On this day, we paid homage to the goddess of learning and sought her blessings for academic success.<br><br>\n\nThe day began with a special assembly, where the teachers performed a traditional puja (worship) to honor Saraswati. We then sang hymns and recited prayers, asking for her blessings. After the assembly, we had a range of activities, including essay writing, poetry recitation, and art competitions. These activities not only helped us celebrate the festival but also allowed us to showcase our creativity and talent.<br><br>\n\nThe highlight of the day was the cultural program, where students performed traditional Nepalese dances and songs dedicated to Saraswati. It was a colorful and vibrant display of Nepalese culture, and it created a sense of joy and pride among the students. The festival ended with the distribution of prasad (blessed food) and the exchange of gifts among classmates, which made the event even more special.<br><br>\n\nSaraswati Puga was a cherished event during my school days, and it taught me the importance of seeking knowledge and education. It also instilled in me a sense of cultural pride and appreciation for our traditions. Even today, years later, I still remember the joy and excitement of Saraswati Puga, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of celebrating our culture and heritage.<br><br>",

While this approach may help them achieve good grades, it may not necessarily help them in their future careers.<br><br>\n\nAlthough certificates and degrees are important for many career paths, employers today value individuals who have a solid understanding of their field of work. Knowing the practical application of what was learned in the classroom is essential. In other words, employers value hands-on experience as much as academic qualifications.<br><br>\n\nIt is therefore important for students to seek opportunities for practical learning such as internships, research, and projects to complement their academic education. These experiences not only enhance the knowledge but also equip students with the skills that are vital in the real-world.<br><br>\n\nIn conclusion, while certificates and degrees are important for professional growth, students should aim to seek knowledge beyond what is required for exams. They should take the opportunity to engage in practical learning experiences and activities that can help them develop the skills and knowledge necessary for a successful career.",

              '"All the world\'s a stage" is a poem written by William Shakespeare in his play "As You Like It". The poem portrays the various stages of human life in a metaphorical way, comparing it to a play where each person has different roles to play. The poem consists of seven stages of life that a man goes through.<br><br>\n\nThe first stage is infancy, where a baby is born and is completely dependent on his mother. The baby cries and laughs, and his world is limited to his mother\'s arms. This stage is characterized by helplessness and innocence.<br><br>\n\nThe second stage is childhood, where a child is full of energy and is eager to learn. He explores the world around him and learns new things every day. This stage is characterized by playfulness and curiosity.<br><br>\n\nThe third stage is the teenage years, where a person experiences many physical and emotional changes. The teenager is full of energy and enthusiasm, and he starts to explore his identity and independence. He also becomes aware of his sexuality and begins to form romantic relationships.<br><br>\n\nThe fourth stage is adulthood, where a person takes on responsibilities such as marriage, family, and career. The adult is no longer dependent on others for survival and becomes more self-reliant. This stage is characterized by hard work and responsibility.<br><br>\n\nThe fifth stage is middle age, where a person becomes more reflective and introspective. He may experience a midlife crisis, where he questions his achievements and the direction of his life. This stage is characterized by self-reflection and contemplation.<br><br>\n\nThe sixth stage is old age, where a person experiences physical and mental decline. He may also face the loss of loved ones and the challenges of declining health. This stage is characterized by wisdom and reflection on life.<br><br>\n\nThe final stage is death, where a person leaves the stage of life and becomes part of history. According to the poem, life is like a play, and each person plays his part and exits the stage. The poem reminds us that life is temporary, and we should make the most of the time we have on this earth.',

During this time, the oral tradition was the only way for people to pass down their stories and cultural traditions. This tradition allowed African Americans to maintain their identity and culture despite the oppressive conditions they faced.\n<br><br>\nLapena also argues that the oral tradition continues to be important in modern times. He suggests that the tradition is still relevant because it allows people to connect with their history and cultural heritage. Additionally, he notes that the oral tradition is a way to communicate with people who are not literate or who may not have access to written materials.\n<br><br>\nOverall, I agree with Lapena's opinions on the importance of the oral tradition. I believe that the oral tradition is an essential part of many cultures and can play a critical role in preserving cultural heritage. The oral tradition allows people to connect with their past and maintain a sense of cultural identity. Additionally, it is a powerful tool for communication and can help bridge gaps between people who may not have access to written materials or who may have different cultural backgrounds.
